/********************* Prime number Generator. *******************
 ** Source Code:	PrimesIO.cpp				**
 ** Author:		Gustavo Islas GÃ¡lvez.			**
 ** Creation Date:	Saturday, December 30, 2023.		**
 ** Purpose:		This program aims to determine the	**
 **			number of prime numbers found in a	**
 **			number determined by the user.		**
 **			It is understood that a prime number is **
 **			one that does not admit more divisors	**
 **			than unity and itself, therefore,	**
 **			if a prime number is divisible by other	**
 **			coefficients, it will then be		**
 **			considered a composite number.		**
 **			This program also stores and retrieves	**
 **			user-generated prime numbers in a file	**
 **			that is always appended to the end of	**
 **			each run of the program.		**

 ** Function:           int main()				**
 ** Explanation:	The purpose of this main function is	**
 **			to ask the user through the keyboard	**
 **			the number of prime numbers they wish	**
 **			to obtain from 1...n.			**
 **			Subsequently, each prime number is	**
 **			created, evaluating that it is not a	**
 **			multiple of 2, 3, 5 and 7, with the	**
 **			exception of said numbers, and a list	**
 **			is saved with each series generated with**
 **			its respective date and time of		**
 **			generation.				**
 **			If the file does not exist, it is	**
 **			created, and if it already existed, each**
 **			generation of prime number lists is	**
 **			added to the end.			**
 ** Input Parms:	None.					**
 ** Output Parms:       None.                                   **
 ** Result:		The result consists of displaying on the**
 **			screen the content of the file saved	**
 **			with each series of prime numbers	**
 **			requested.				**
 **			Note: It has been purposely that the	**
 **			first index of generation of prime	**
 **			numbers, that is, the zero index number,**
 **			contains the value one, so that from	**
 **			index one onwards, the exact prime	**
 **			numbers are obtained.			**
